# FreeEMG device - applications

In this directory we store the `yarpmanager` applications based on the FreeEmg weareable device.

The applications use the [provided configuration files](../conf/). Check the [configuration file directory README](../conf/README.md) for the list of parameters that can be overridden.

### FreeEmgLog

The application [`FreeEmgLog`](FreeEmgLog.xml) allows the user to save EMG signal data in a `.mat` file.

### FreeEmgVisualization

The application [`FreeEmgVisualization`](FreeEmgVisualization.xml) allows the user to see a plot of the EMG signals.
